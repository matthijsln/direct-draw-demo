For windowed version:
  - Make sure your desktop bpp is 32 bits per pixel

For fullscreen version:
  - Use Alt+F4 to exit
  - Don't use ALT+TAB or CTRL+ESCAPE or the intro will crash
  - If the debug version hangs, *do* try ALT+TAB and switch back
    again, maybe there's an error messagebox visible then
